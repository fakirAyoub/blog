Hi! I'm Ayoub, a Senior Data Engineer absolutely passionate about data technologies. I mainly work on Distributed Systems (Hadoop / Kubernetes / Cloud Technologies), Functional Programming (Haskell / Scala / Clojure) and Blockchain Technologies (Ethereum / Bitcoin / Hyperledger, and more recently got into the Polkadot ecosystem).

I do consulting as well as teaching (Paris 12 University).

You can contact me to say Hi, to talk about your projects or to hire me: ayoub[at]fakir.dev
